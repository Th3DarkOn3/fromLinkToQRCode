# fromLinkToQRCode
A python script that gives a url generates a qrcode of it and saves it in the folder chosen by the user

##Before use:
This script works on all operating systems but before downloading it (link) preparations must be made:
1. Installing python
2. install the qrcode library using the following command (administrator permissions required):
```
pip3 install qrcode
```

if you have any errors in the installation or execution of the script I recommend installing a virtual environment via the python VENV function( https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html )
